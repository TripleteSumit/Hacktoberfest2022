// House Robber
/*
 * problem statement: 
 * 
 * A thief needs to rob money in a street. The houses in the street are arranged in a circular manner.
 * Therefore the first and the last house are adjacent to each other. The security system int he street is such
 * that if adjacent houses are rubbed, the police will be notified.
 * 
 * Given an array of integer "Arr" which represnets money at each house, 
 * we need to return maximum amount of money that the thief can rob without alerting the police.
